# Even Fibonacci Numbers

## Part 1
- Create a Rust console application using `cargo`
- Add our starter code to your project
- Displays a welcome message to the user
- Prompts the user to input their first name and store it
- prompts the user to input their last name and store it

## Part 2

> Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
> 
> 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
>
<!-- > By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms. -->

- Ask user to enter maximum number and parse it to a number.
- Be sure to handle for errors!
- By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed given maximum number, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

Ex: 4,000,000 will give you x

## Part 3

- Search for ferris-says on crates.io
- Using the documentation, add the dependency to your project

ðŸ¦€  Have an error after compiling your code? Try doing what the error message suggests.
- Use Ferris to output the users first and last name, as well as sum from part two.
